# Nvim Config

**New switch to nvim**

I switched to neovim for development because a lot of the plugins I wanted to use weren't available on vim.

I now *primarily* use neovim as my IDE with the configuration found in this dir: [init.vim](https://gitlab.com/Jasioski/dev-config-files/-/blob/master/config_files/not_in_setup_file/nvim/init.vim)
